        <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
        <p scope="col">Test-driven development is designed to provide feedback at intervals of seconds or minutes on
          whether current software development is making progress in the right direction. If the development takes too
          long until all tests can be run again without errors, this feedback is missing and a slower development speed
          is the result. We often notice that many developers are still able to handle the first two or three TDD cycles
          smoothly, but the subsequent cycles are so slow that one can hardly speak of test-driven development. We have
          therefore developed a systematic approach that leads to continuous progress in short TDD cycles. Following the
          two well-known TDD approaches - "Chicago school" and "London school" - we have named this approach St. Pauli
          school of TDD.</p>

                  string for each line and the function name should be “diamond”. Since a function with this name does

                  arguments of the function. There is only one argument of the diamond function and it is named $char.
                  The $ sign has no special meaning, we just use it to prefix the variable name since there is already a
                  char function provided by Clojure. Since the diamond function does not return anything, we are still
                  in the red state, but now the test result is much more helpful:
                  <code>expected: (= ["a"] (diamond \a)), actual: (not (= ["a"] nil))</code>
                  That means, (diamond \a) should return ["a”], but it returns nil, and nil is not ["a"].

                  we can use the reduce function: The result of (reduce + 0 [1 2 3]) is 6 and the result of (reduce conj
                  [] [1 2 3]) is [1 2 3]). That means, exchanging the vector [“__x__” “_y_y_” “z___z”] with (reduce conj
                  [][“__x__” “_y_y_” “z___z”]) is getting us closer to the real iterative construction of the pyramid

                  names to elements of a collection parameter. As formulated in the tests, the API of the middle-line
                  function expects a vector as the single argument, representing one element of an indexed alphabet. The
                  first element of that vector is the index within the alphabet, so we assign the name index to that
                  element. The second element is the actual character which we assign the name $char (again, the prefix
                  $ is just there to avoid a name collision with the function char).</td>

                  Instead we notice, that the middle line string consists of three parts: For all characters with an
                  index larger than 0, the first and the last part are always the same and only the middle part changes
                  dynamically depending on the input. Hence we use tiny baby-steps to split the string in three parts.

                  with underscores, we enhance it so that it can surround a value with arbitrary values. We do not write
                  a test for that enhancement because we feel confident that we can simply write the correct
                  implementation in short time. This approach is called “Obvious Implementation”. As a rule of thumb, we
                  only use this pattern when writing the real implementation is faster than an average TDD cycle.</td>

                  is created depending on the arguments. If the index is 0, the middle-line is simple the character. If
                  the index is 1, one underscore is surrounded by zero additional underscores and the input character.
                  If the index is 2, one underscore is surrounded by underscores once and the input character. If the
                  index is 3, one underscore is surrounded by underscores twice and the input character. The else-case
                  describes to this point only the behaviour when index is 2. That means, if we surround an underscore
                  with underscores once, we get the same result as the hard-coded “___” string.</td>

                  function and call it with the collection and the index of 0: (nth [3 4 5] 0) return 3. iterate takes a
                  mapping function and an initial value and returns an infinite sequence that starts with the initial
                  value and whose consecutive values are the mapping function applied to the previous element of the
                  sequence: (first (iterate inc 0)) returns 0 and (nth (iterate inc 50) 3) returns 53. Since (first

                  characters. On the other hand, this design reveals on the highest abstraction level, that the diamonds
                  always start with the \a character. If we formulated this restriction within the pyramid function, it
                  would have been buried one abstraction lever deeper in the code. One could also argue with the Single
                  Responsibility Principle: If we change the starting character of a diamond to a capital A, not only
                  the diamonds-tests would break but also the pyramid-tests. There are more arguments whether one design
                  is better than the other, but in conclusion, both decisions would be ok.</td>
